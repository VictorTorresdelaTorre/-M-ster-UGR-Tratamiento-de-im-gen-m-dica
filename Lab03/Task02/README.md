# Lab03 - Task 02

Write a program that reads an image from a file and displays the result of applying the previous thresholding filters to the input image. The idea is to obtain a segmentation of some region of interest that you can identify in the image. Try this program with the input images: BrainProtonDensitySlice256x256.png , saltAndPepperNoise1.jpg , saltAndPepperNoise2.jpg , and gaussianNoise.jpg . You may read the source codes BinaryThresholdImageFilter.cxx and ThresholdImageFilter.cxx placed at ‘ ITK_DIR/Examples/Filtering ’ to get a clue about how to program this task.
