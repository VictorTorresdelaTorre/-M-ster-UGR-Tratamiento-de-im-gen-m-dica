# Lab05 - Task 07

Now try out to read the images that I provided to you ( t50.bmp up to t60.bmp ) and write them in .mhd format. You will need something like the following output format string: "t %02d.bmp" . After that, check that you have correctly created a 3D image dataset by reading the file .mhd . Finally, write a program that reads the recently created .mhd file and displays the eleven images in a viewer. You will need to read the code in ImageReadExtractWrite.cxx and read the online documentation of itk::ExtractImageFilter
