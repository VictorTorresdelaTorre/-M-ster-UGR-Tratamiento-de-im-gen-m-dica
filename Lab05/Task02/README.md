# Lab05 - Task 02

In this task we will run an example that illustrates explicit instantiation of an IO class (in this case a VTK file format), setting its parameters and then connecting it to the ImageFileWriter . The source code for this example can be found in the file ImageReadExportVTK.cxx . Read the corresponding section in the ITK guide2 and try this program with the image BrainProntonDensity3slices.mha that you can find in the ITK_DIR/Examples/Data . Although this example only illustrates how to use an explicit ImageIO class with the ImageFileWriter class, the same can be done with the ImageFileReader . The typical case in which this is done is when reading raw image files with the RawImageIO object. The drawback of this approach is that the parameters of the image have to be explicitly written in the code. The direct use of raw files is strongly discouraged in medical imaging. It is always better to create a header for a raw file by using any of the file formats that combine a text header file and a raw binary file, like MetaImageIO , GiplImageIO and VTKImageIO .
