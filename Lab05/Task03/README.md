# Lab04 - Task 03

In this task we will run an example that illustrates how to read and write RGB color images to and from a file. You have to build the example in the file RGBImageReadWrite.cxx . Run the program with a color image such as VisibleWomanHeadSlice.png in ’ITK_DIR/Examples/Data ’ directory. Try to write a code to display a color image using the ItkVtkGlue module capabilities ( QuickView.h ).
