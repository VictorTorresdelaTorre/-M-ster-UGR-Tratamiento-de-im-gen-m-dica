# Lab05 - Task 03

In this task we will run an example that shows how to make an appropriate pipeline to cast an image correctly. You have to build the example in the file ImageReadCastWrite.cxx . Run the program with an image from ’ ITK_DIR/Examples/Data ’. Next, write a program that reads a image and applies an IntensityBasedImage filter and displays the input and filtered images in a viewer.
