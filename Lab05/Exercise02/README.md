# Lab05 - Exercise 02

Finally, read the section “Reading a 2D DICOM Series and Writing a Volume” of the ITK guide2 and the code in DicomSeriesReadImageWrite2.cxx . Try to write a program that reads the DICOM files provided in the data directory: IMG13 to IMG30 , and write a single .mhd file that groups all of them in a 3D dataset. Look at the written file to check the metadata are correct. Now you may use the last program you wrote in task07 to visualize the DICOM data!
