# Lab04 - Task 01

Write a program that reads an image from a file and displays the result of applying the following cfilters to the input image: ConnectedThresholdImageFilter , NeighborhoodConnectedImageFilter , and ConfidenceConnectedImageFilter . The idea is to obtain several results by combining thefree parameters of each filter, and by using or not a noise reduction filter over an input image before applying each one of these filters. The idea is to learn how the different filter parameters affect the segmentation result and observe how the application, or not, of a noise reduction filter previously in the pipeline affects the segmentation result. Try this program with the input images: BrainProtonDensitySlice256x256.png , coronaryAngiogram.png , saltAndPepperNoise1.jpg , and gaussianNoise.jpg .
