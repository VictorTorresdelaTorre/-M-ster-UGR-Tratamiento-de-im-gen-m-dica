# Lab02 - Task 02

Write a program that reads an image from a file and displays the result of applying two mean filters with neighborhood size of 3 × 3 and 5 × 5, respectively; and two median filters with the same neighborhood sizes. Try the program with the following images: saltAndPepperNoise1.jpg , saltAndPepperNoise2.jpg , and gaussianNoise.jpg. You may read the source code MeanImageFilter.cxx and MedianImageFilter.cxx placed at ‘ITK_DIR/Examples/Filtering’ to understand the use of both filters.
