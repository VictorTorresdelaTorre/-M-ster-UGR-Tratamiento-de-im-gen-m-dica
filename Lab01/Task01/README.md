# Lab01 - Task 01

In this task our goal is to generate our first executable program and we just need to look up on the
section “Getting Started with ITK” in the guide. You can see in figure 1 a screenshot of the CMake’s
ncurses GUI with the configuration options ready to generate the project. You must remember after
generating the project files, on UNIX/Linux systems the project has to be compiled by typing make in
the terminal provided that the current directory is set to the project’s binary directory.
